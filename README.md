# Raycaster-py
 
 This project is for learning how a raycaster works and render it using a technique similar to Wolfstein 3D.

# Controls:

If you want to test it have in mind the controls.

'1' changes rendering mode, only vertical lines, horizontal or both.

'W', 'A', 'S' and 'D' moves the player.

The mouse can be used to change the 2d map (click where you want or not a block) and for fps like camera,
Quotes key(at the left of '1' key) changes the camera from mouse free to fps like.

That's it! More improvement and debugging on the way.
